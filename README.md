# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-Model
Welcome to my Titanic Survival Prediction repository! In this project, we delve into the historical data of the Titanic tragedy (1912) to predict the survival outcomes of passengers using machine learning algorithms. Here, our aim is to analyze the factors that influenced survival rates of passengers.
